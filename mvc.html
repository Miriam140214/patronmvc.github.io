# Model-View-Controller

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern assigns objects in an application one of three roles: model, view, or controller. 
The pattern defines not only the roles objects play in the application, it defines the way objects communicate with each other. Each of the three types of objects is separated from the others by abstract boundaries and communicates with objects of the other types across those boundaries. The collection of objects of a certain MVC type in an application is sometimes referred to as a layer—for example, model layer.

A **model** is an object representing data or even activity, e.g. a database table or even some plant-floor     production-machine process.
A **view** is some form of visualization of the state of the model.
A **controller** offers facilities to change the state of the model. 

# Creating a new project <br>
Actually, all new projects are created same way: by clicking the Create New Project button in the Quick Start area of the Welcome screen.

<p>If you have an already opened project, create a new one by choosing File → New Project.... Then, select the desired project type (here it is Django). Specify the project name and location, the Python interpreter to be used for this project (remember, having at least one Python interpreter is one of the prerequisites of this tutorial!)and the Python application name (here it is polls)</p>

##Click Create - the Django project is ready.<br>

Project view of the Project tool window
This view is displayed by default. It shows the Django-specific project structure: polls and mysite directories; also, you see the manage.py and settings.py files.

You cannot see the .idea directory in this view:<br>

###Project Files view of the Project tool window <br>
If for some reasons you would like to see contents of the .idea directory, choose the view Project Files: as you see, this view shows same directories and files, plus .idea directory, since it is located under the project root.<br>
